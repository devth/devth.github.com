# Good programmers should not be using Eclipse

- You can't avoid terminal
- So you should embrace it
- Turns out terminal is a much more productive way of working
- Eclipse is a mess
  - When your tools are a mess, your process is a mess which bleeds into your
    thoughts.
  - So much harder to reduce complexity when you're already entrenched in it


Eclipse is a ceiling on productivity and effectiveness, an eternally-blunt
object. You may argue that Eclipse is modular, is extensible, etc., and that's
fine, but the community and culture of Eclipse today is evidence itself of
Eclipse's own potential: not much.

Why would you willingly put a cap on your own potential?
