# The Inner Loop

## Organization Hierarchy

Think of levels in an organization hierarchy as loops in a running program.

The outermost loop is the CEO.

The innermost loops are the individual contributors (ICs).

And the loops in between are the managers, directors, and VPs.

## Optimization

You can optimize an inner loop and it makes the immediate parent outer loop
faster, more efficient, more impactful.

The effect each on successive parent loop is magnified, extending all the way up
the stack.

- Increase the productivity of every IC on every team
- Every manager below their director produces more work
- Every director's time spent planning chunks of work covers more ground
- Every VP's ability to strategically maneuver and execute is increased
- The CEO ultimate runs a more nimble, higher impact company that can respond to
  market conditions, external factors, and brilliant ideas

## Ok, so what?

**So optimize your innermost loops**. Stop holding meaningless meetings, cargo
cult scrum ceremonies, sprint planning, quarterly planning, all hands,
endless training, performance reviews, interviews for new candidate.

And ~if~ when you do decide to hold these, be aware of the exponential,
cascading cost up the entire chain.
