# The Inner Loop

## Organization Hierarchy

Think of levels in an organization hierarchy as loops in a running program.

The outermost loop is the CEO.

The innermost loops are the individual contributors (ICs).

And the loops in between are the managers, directors, and VPs.

## Optimization

You can optimize an inner loop and it makes the immediate parent outer loop
faster, more efficient, more impactful - able to complete more work in the same
amount of time.

The effect each on successive parent loop is magnified, extending all the way up
the stack. When you increase the productivity of every IC on every team across
a company (i.e. optimize the inner loops):

- Every manager delivers more work in shorter periods of time
- Every director's time spent prioritizing, planning and bucketing chunks of
  work covers more ground
- Every VP's ability to strategically maneuver and execute is increased
- The CEO ultimate runs a more nimble, higher impact company that can react with
  speed to market conditions, external factors, and new ideas

## Ok, So What?

**So optimize your innermost loops**. Stop holding meaningless meetings for
every could-have-been-a-slack-thread, sprint planning, quarterly planning, all
hands, endless training, performance reviews, interviews for new candidates, and
cargo culting scrum ceremonies.

And ~if~ when you do decide to hold these, try to chunk them at the beginning or
end of the day and be aware of the exponential, cascading cost up the entire
chain.
