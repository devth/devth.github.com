We have oversizes monitors that could support the most obscene line lengths
imaginable but in spite of this (better: in support) you should write code in
max 80 column lines. Unless you write Java or similarly needlessly verbose
languages, in which case it's time to expand your mind and move past 90s tech.

Why?

Code density.

Observe my "airplane IDE" during travel where I don't have the luxury of a
monitor. Yet I am not crippled. I still thrive because I embrace constraint.

And when I am at home with opulent monitor, it gets even better, with increased
number of files at the same time.

Anyway: don't you want to carry the torch of tradition for our wonderfully
constrained technological predecessors?
