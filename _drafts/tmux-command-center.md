Things developers love:

- Control
- Consistency in tools and process
- Many bits of relevant knowledge at their fingertips

I'm a developer and I love these things, which is why I use tmux as the base
layer of my highly curated productivity framework.

Tmux:

- Meets a much higher standard of stability, performance, and consistency
  than any GUI
- Is simple yet powerful
- Is scriptable
- Integrates perfectly with all your Unix tools
- Has a highly customizable statusline that acts like the
  [HUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky) we all wanted IRL

To sum it up, tmux with unix on top is the real life incarnation of the
futuristic sci-fi interfaces us technophiles dream about. Or maybe you dream
about Minority Report, but forget that. Minority Report has all the usability of
Windows ME with your grandma at the helm. Unless your grandma was Grace Hopper.
No. What we need is a much sharper tool. The precision of text and processes who
output real, usable data.
