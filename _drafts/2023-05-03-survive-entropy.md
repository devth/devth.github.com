# Will it survive entropy?

When deciding what to custom build or even run internally vs use a managed service,
it can be useful to think through the lens of entropy and extropy at a company.

The main product itself is undergoing constant extropy. Engineers come and go
but the product is always on a growth trajectory, being recompiled from current
state into some better state with better utility and better design and newer
underlying technology. 

Underneath the product are many layers of supporting infrastructure and
technology, and the further from the product it gets the less regular extropy
happens, and it becomes more likely to be given over to the natural forces of
entropy.

Ask ChatGPT to generate reviews 3 years from now for what you're building by
engineers who join the company 18 months from now. 

Which of these do you think it most closely resembles?

- A retrospective on what went wrong and how to prevent it
- "Wow whoever wrote this did a great job thinking about the future needs of the
  company and set us up for success"
- I understand why they did it this way at the time but now it no longer makes
  sense.
- I wish they had integrated this in an orthogonal manner so it'd more of a
  two-way decision
