# Will it survive entropy?

When deciding what to custum build or even run internally vs use a managed service,
it can be useful to think through the lens of entropy and extropy at a company.

The main product itself is undergoing comstant extropy. Eng fomes and goes but the product is always on 
a growth trajectlry, being recomciled from current state
into some better state with better utility and better design
and newer underlying trxhnology. 

Underneath the product are many layers of supporting
infrastructure and technology, and the further from the product it gets the less
regular extropy happens, and it becomes more likely to be given over to the natural forces
of entropy.
