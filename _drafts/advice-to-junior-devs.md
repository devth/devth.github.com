Fresh out of college with a degree in compsci? Perhaps even a masters? Don't
make the mistake of feeling overconfident. The truth is everything you know is
somewhere between very outdated and somewhat outdated. But it is a great
foundation for what you'll learn next. Or maybe you didn't go to college but
learned some languages here and there, tinkered with programming in highschool,
and you feel like an all-powerful wizard. Not to discourage you, but you know
nothing. And even after you learn a hundred lessons, you still know nothing. But
that's ok. The important part is that you know that you know nothing, and what
you plan to do about it. Beware that this is a never-ending journey. You don't
arrive. But you do get to reach higher and higher planes of thought and
understanding. And you do get to teach others along the way.
