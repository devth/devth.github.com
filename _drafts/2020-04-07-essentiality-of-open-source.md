excerpt: "The essentiality of open source"
---

Many software engineers are unfamiliar with open source and have never
contributed, but we all consume it, heavily. As such, I suggest that all
software engineers have familiarity with open source and consider open source
contribution as part of the foundational culture and rhythm of software
engineering. It could be authoring a new project or contributing to other
projects. It could be writing tests and documentation, or helping users in the
community chat room or on StackOverflow, or blogging about your experience with
various tools and libraries.

## Essentiality

Imagine if we didn't have languages, tools and web frameworks to build on top
of. Or if we had to purchase a license to use some stack (a well known company
already tried this and apparently decided [open source was a superior
strategy](https://opensource.com/business/14/11/microsoft-dot-net-empower-open-source-communities)).

Progress would be significantly slowed. Instead of going from idea to `rails
new` and having a proof of concept in a few hours or days you'd be reinventing
the wheel for the nth time or scouring pricing information to figure out which
stack strikes the right balance of time savings and cost savings. In other
words: not building.

## It legitimizes your work

Code and systems that have gone through the crucible of public scrutiny and
survived are that much stronger, more legitimate, with vastly more permanence.

It forces the author to create and maintain all the peripheral work around a
solid piece of technology. It pushes the tech through edge cases and unexpected
use cases. It forces one to write documentation, maintain test coverage, publish
artifacts, build community, and consider how much generality is sufficient to
elevate a system from one-off usage to becoming useful in other contexts making
itself resilient to bit-rot.

It forces the author to achieve a level of excellence that probably wouldn't
have otherwise been realized without the extrinsic motivation.

Contrast this with internal code. Whether that code lives or gets extirpated
depends on a ton of variable factors in the company. Reorganizations, rewrites,
politics, strategy, and all kinds of other factors out of your control affect
the longevity of your code. And if it does live on for some amount of time, it
will most likely be just good enough to maybe barely do what it's supposed to,
in a perpetual alpha state. Many Project Managers don't understand the value in
comprehensive technical excellence, and therefore won't prioritize technical
debt cleanup, necessary refactoring, coverage, documentation, or giving talks.

After working X years at Y corp don't you want something to show for yourself?
As for me, every time I solve a problem the first thing I ask is "can this be
open sourced?"

## It sharpens your skills

When you put your work out in the open, you invite criticism. That may seem
scary, but you know makes it more than worth it? Leveling up your skills and
sharpening your thoughts in the crucible of public opinion. Do hard things and
you can't help but grow and become stronger and more mature in the process.

## Social Responsibility

Great. You've decided open source is worth pursuing. You want to make the world
a better place. So what is your responsibility to the community when you open
source a project and that project achieves some degree of fame or number of
users? Do you "owe" your users nothing?

If your thing is worth the attention of the community there is a certain
standard of excellence that should be achieved and maintained. By achieving some
level of recognition, whether you wanted it or not, you now have a
responsibility to your users.

- make a best effort to ensure the quality and security of your code
- publish a roadmap
- let users know how they can contribute
  - optional: welcome new users and offer to mentor engineers who are making
    an honest effort to learn and grow
- be open to feedback and criticism
- aim for the good of the community
- fix bugs in a reasonable amount of time
- pass off stewardship and leadership if you personally can't commit to the
  above

These are not easy things to do. Ideally we engineers have the support of our
employers to uphold this commitment to social good and technical excellence.
After all, it's often the tech companies who are directly benefiting financially
from the wealth of open source technology that they build upon.

## Epilogue

We consume millions of hours of work put into the technology we use and built
atop every day. Each of us will never come close to giving back as much as we
consume. But please contribute if you can, however great or small, from a place
of joy, curiosity, and sincerity, striving to to advance technology and shape
community while growing yourself. Be an advocate for building culture that cares
about open source at your company.

Raise the floor.
