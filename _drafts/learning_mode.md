How to get students in that mode where everything they read or learn is
productive? Avoid brute force techniques:

- Deadlines
- Tests
- Set curriculum


# What things can I do to learn something?

- Have a project (hobby or real world, not throw-away)
- Split concept into small parts and master them within the context of a project


## Examples of learning things:

- Programming languages
- Programming concepts (concurrency, immutability, functional programming)
- Electronics


## Self directed learning

- You don't know what you don't know yet
- If you try to learn it in the context of a class/curriculum, it might help
  teach the right things, but you still don't know why you need to know, so you
  don't care
- You need to both 1) know what to learn 2) know why you need it
- Need is a great motivator.
- Curiosity is a secondary motivator: when you come across something
  interesting, go on a rabbit trail. Go deep. Become aware of the entire field.


## School does not equip you for the real world

- Technology changes so fast, most of what you learn in (already outdated)
  classes are no longer relevant.
- So you must know how to learn, or learn to learn very quickly. But first you
  need to learn how to learn how to learn :)


## Persistence and repetition

## Write-once-read-never notes
