What is a manager's job?


It's to enable a team of individual contributors to build, and to amplify their
output. Build with quality. Build with speed. Build with joy. With space for
creativity. Space to obsess over the details. Space to talk to their customers
and understand their needs.

What gets in the way of ICs building and delivering?

Well, things that are not building or delivering. Obviously.

And what are the things that are not building or delivering that ICs have to
deal with?

Whatever you make them.

When you put an invite on an IC's (or group of ICs') calendar(s), are you aware
of the cost?

So how can a manager effectively enable and amplify?

- Bring context
- Remove barriers (political, technical)
- Fill in gaps in process
