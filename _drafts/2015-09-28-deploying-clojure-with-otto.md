Otto is a new project by Hashicorp, the folks behind Vagrant, and claims to be
the successor to Vagrant. I just so happened to need some automation for
deploying my Clojure-based chat bot, so I decidded to give it a go. Given Otto's
intended usage my goals are to:

0. Automate creation of a dev environment
0. Automate deployment to a production environment


## Setup

Otto has a great [Getting
Started](https://ottoproject.io/intro/getting-started/dev.html) writeup that I
highly recommend.
