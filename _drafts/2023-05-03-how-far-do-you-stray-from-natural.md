A process or behavior can be graded on how "natural" it seems.

Performance reviews always bring up this feeling.

It's fairly unnatural to write about yourself, especially in the third person.

But we do it, because we know it's tied to compensation, promotion, and career
opportunities.

Being forced into an unnatural process creates cognitive dissonance and contains
any true excellence that may be lying underneath.

- Overprofessionalism
- Business Jargon
- Cringe leadership
- Leadership posturing or putting on an act to make it seem like they have
  authority
