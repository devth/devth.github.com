Programming, tools and process are stuck in the past, held in place by hoards
of OO-wielding proletariats collectively chanting "good enough".

## Required reading

- [Complexity and Learning (2011)](http://mth.io/posts/complexity-and-learning/)

## Recommended reading

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
  Have you read a million monad tutorials and still don't get it? This was the
  case for me when I embarked on that journey. Learning Haskell is what made it
  finally click for me. As a bonus, this book is also hilarious and brilliantly
  written and illustrated.
- [Learning Scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/)
  This series of blog posts loosely follows LYAH and introduces
  [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)' equivalents to many of Haskell's
  classes.
