Programming, tools and process are stuck in the past, held in place by hoards
of OO-wielding proletariats collectively chanting "good enough".

Let's find a better way.

## Required reading

- [Complexity and Learning (2011)](http://mth.io/posts/complexity-and-learning/)
  — The view on learning and applying knowledge described here is one I've long
  held and argued for. This post uses an intuitive anaology of runtime
  complexity to describe learning a concept and the cost of applying it over
  time.

## Recommended reading

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) by
  Miran Lipovača — Have you read a million monad tutorials and still don't get
  it? This was the case for me and learning Haskell is what made it finally
  click. As a bonus, this book is also hilarious and brilliantly written and
  illustrated; one of my all time favorites.

- [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/) by Paul
  Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason — Many of my topics and ideas came from this
  book.

- [Learning Scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/)
  — This series of blog posts loosely follows LYAH and introduces
  [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)' equivalents to many of Haskell's
  classes.
