Programming, tools and process are stuck in the past, held in place by hoards
of OO-wielding proletariats collectively chanting "good enough".

Let's find a better way.

## Recommended works

We are inundated with programming posts of varying quality. This is a curated
list of only the best or most important I've come across.

### Philosophy

- [Isaac Asimov Asks, “How Do People Get New
  Ideas?”](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/)
  — An insightful essay on the fragile process of creativity by the brilliant
  science fiction writer.

- [Complexity and Learning (2011)](http://mth.io/posts/complexity-and-learning/)
  — The view on learning and applying knowledge described here is one I've long
  held and argued for. This post uses an intuitive anaology of runtime
  complexity to describe learning a concept and the cost of applying it over
  time.

### Functional Programming

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) by
  Miran Lipovača — Have you read a million monad tutorials and still don't get
  it? This was the case for me and learning Haskell is what made it finally
  click. As a bonus, this book is also hilarious and brilliantly written and
  illustrated; one of my all time favorites.

- [Category Theory for
  Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
  — I'll be working through this for quite a long time, but it's mind blowing
  and very challenging so far.

- [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/) by Paul
  Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason — Many of my topics and ideas came from this
  book.

- [Learning Scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/)
  — This series of blog posts loosely follows LYAH and introduces
  [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)' equivalents to many of Haskell's
  classes.

### Distributed Systems

- [Raft: Understandable Distributed
  Consensus](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) - amazing and inspiring data
  visualization of the Raft consensus algorithm. Even if you're not interested
  in Raft itself, go through this because it demonstrates so well the power of
  visualization in understanding complex interactions. (How can we get this level
  of quality in our own systems' documentation?)

### Writing

- [Linguistics, Style and Writing in the 21st Century - with Steven
  Pinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5J6BfToSw) (YouTube)
  — A wonderful and highly entertaining talk about writing. We should pursue
  excellence in this area as knowledge workers since writing is a core part of
  what we do.

  Some gems:

  > Writing is an act of pretense.

  > Writing is an act of craftsmanship.

  > Writing is an unnatural act

  > Prose as a window onto the world
  > - The writer has seen something in the world
  > - He positions the reader so she can see it with her own eyes

  > The reader and writer are equals

  > The goal is to help the reader see objective reality

  Beautiful idea that the reader and writer are equals. Do not write in a way
  that is above critics or attempts to cover all bases, to be impenetrable.

  Show examples, often! Focus on the subject! Not meta concerns such as the
  studying of the thing, the process, etc.

  > Minimize the kind of apologizing that academics in particular feel compelled
  > to do.

  > Classic prose gives the reader credit for knowing that many concepts are
  > hard to define, many controversies hard to resolve.
  > The reader is there to see what the writer will do about it.

  > Minimize hedging

  > Classic prose: Better to be clear & possibly wrong than muddy and "not even
  > wrong."

  > Count on the cooperative nature of ordinary conversation

  > Use the active voice. The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous
  > than the passive.

  Interesting idea: a sentence is a linear string of words but it's describing a
  non-linear graph of knowledge. It presents some bits of information to the
  reader before others, affecting the way the information is absorbed. The
  passive voice allows writers to vary the order in which ideas are presented
  and absorbed.

  > Good writer narrate a story, advanced by protagonists who make things
  > happen.

  > Bad writer work backwards from their own knowledge, writing down iades in
  > the order in which they occur to them.

  > They begin with the outcome of an event, and then throw in the cause as an
  > afterthought.

  > The passive makes that easy.

  Ouch.

  > The curse of knowledge

  > When you know something, it's hard to imagine what it is like for someone
  > else not to know it. aka mindblindness, egocentrism, hindsight bias

  aka Monads 😂

  Something to consider for technical writers!


  Such density of good advice in this talk. But if you'd rather not watch an
  hour-long video, start with [Steven's short Twitter thread on the same
  topic](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1084490338629242880.html).
