We have a limited capacity to focus. Mid-career, after I had spent many years in
frontend, I had what felt like an explosion of learning. I was so excited and
devoured languages, concepts, libraries, etc. During this time I learned Scala,
Clojure, and Haskell. I learned about Cateogry Theory. Monads. Functors.
Applicatives.

Then it all slowed down. I got bored and complacement. I quit learning as much.
Meanwhile, frontend tech and the JavaScript language took off, rapidly evolving
through yearly ECMAScript revisions and tech that let everyone use it before
browsers could catch up: Babel, Webpack. On the library side, React came out
along with a million ideas of how to do the M and C on top of React's V. Flux,
Redux, plus every other language's conceptual equivalent, such as Om.next and
Reagent.

This year I came back to full time front end, a little overwhelmed and shocked
at how much things had evolved since 2013 when I was last a full time FE
engineer.
