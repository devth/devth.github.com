# Office Remodel

Working remotely means you spend **a lot** of time in your home office. After
doing so for almost 4 years I figured it was time to actually optimize the
space. Up till now it's been an unfinished, cold, mostly concrete space. While
it's cool and somewhat industrial, it's not exactly comfortable.

## Requirements

Given the cost of a remodel project, my biggest limiting factor has always been
getting it just right. I don't want to shell out thousands for something I don't
love.

But figuring out what you like and why is hard. I looked through tons of
Uncrate, minimal office posts, architecture case studies, ...

- Standing desk
- VESA monitor mount
- Work spaces for electronics projects
- ?

- Light
  - Egress window
