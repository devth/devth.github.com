- give back
  - we consume mountains of open source
  - move the state of the art forward, even if by a microscopic fraction of a
    percent
  - let others build on your work, the way you've built on others'

- legitimize your project. Force you to achieve a level of excellence that you
  wouldn't otherwise without the extrinsic motivation. Force you to write
  - CI
  - docs
  - tests
  - chat

- force you to think about your project, and identify if it should exist.
  consider how many one-off things we build as professional software engineers.
  how much of an increase in generality is required to elevate a project from
  one-off (throw away, succumb to bitrot) to pushing the state of the art?

- work in the real world
  - people in other companies
  - people in other countries

- have something to show for yourself after a X year tenure at company Y

As for me, when I start a new project the first thing I ask is "can this be open
sourced?"
