## Tenants

1. Never break backward compatibility. Ever. All changes are in the form of
   accretion.
1. Allow users to opt in to new functionality iteratively, by usage, not by
   `x.y.z` in your dependency manager.
1. Language / dependency manager agnostic.

## Rationale

It's expensive to practice.

1. Is it worth it?
1. Can it be automatically verified?

## Implementation
