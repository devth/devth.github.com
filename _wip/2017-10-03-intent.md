Over and over again when I'm reading people's code, I get lost because it's not
clear what the code was intended just by reading its implementation. This is
often the case because **alert** implementations are buggy.

Recently I was reading through some tests that were supposed to mock an external
service, but they weren't. They were also passing, because they happened to be
missing asserts in async callback code. So here we have passing tests (that
means it works, right?), incorrect tests, and nothing expressing the intent of
what the test was actually supposed to do.

How do we express intent? Be generous with comments, and adhere to charitable
communication. Miscommunication is the default. We need something to escape it!
