As a highly obsessive continuous improver of process as a means to productivity
+ 1, here are my tools and workflow for the open-minded wanderer.

Let's start with the fundamentals.

## Fundamentals

### Terminal

Terminal is at the heart of everything we do as devs (or at least it should be).
You can't escape it (unless you're a .NET dev).

### Tmux

Bring sanity to the terminal. Seriously. I didn't know how badly I needed tmux
until I started using it. It's now an **essential** part of my stack. At the
same time I adopted tmux, I abandoned gvim in order to consolidate all my tools
to run inside the terminal.

## Swimming upstream

Your work may have standardized around a different set of tools. It's tempting
to conform â€” don't! If you use the same tools as the majority of coworkers at
each job you work, you'll never master an efficient flow.
