Creativity is a fragile and fleeting thing. How does one get inspired? How does
one stay inspired?

Those questions are hard to answer. The inverse might be easier: "how do you
squash creativity?"

I can describe my path over the last 7 years through periods of extreme
inspiration and productivity and relative burnout.

Explore relationship between:

1. Creativity
1. Productivity
1. Fun

These are highly connected.

Things that kill creativity:

- hostility
- unsafe environment
- ridicule
- unproductive feedback
- feeling under appreciated
- feeling undervalued relative to other team members
- rarely rewarded or acknowledged for creative solutions
- demanding higher output
- demanding more creativity
- tedium, boredom, inefficient process, bureaucracy

Things that inspire productivity.

- open mindedness
- humility
- empathy
- being well paid
- having fun
- high tech
  - systems
  - languages
  - automation
  - blazing fast dev setup (compile time must be < 2s)
- opportunity to solve problems in a novel way
  - don't want to just glue all the time (some of the time is ok)
- open source - opportunity to share your work publicly and collab with
  community
- high trust
- respected among peers
