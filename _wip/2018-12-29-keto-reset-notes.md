# Keto Reset Diet

## Benefits

### Metabolic flexibility

- Survive on fewer calories

- Minimal Insulin under the curve
  - Minimal amount of insulin necessary to keep you healthy and functional
  - Insulin reduces lifespan
  - Minimize risk of diet related problems caused by overfeeding

- Anti inflammatory nature of burning ketones

- Insulin causes reactive oxygen species

### Athletic performance

- Thrive on fewer calories
- Ideal body composition

Athletes typically think "if the furnace is hot enough anything will burn".

Metabolic disease risk factors found in fitness enthusiasts.

Produces accelerated cell division when consuming tons of calories.

The exception is IronMan athletes who are training at very high intensity
levels.

### Weight loss

Excellent way to lose weight. If you burn calories during exercise stimulate an
increased appetite for carbohydrates. You also justify being more lazy
throughout the day. Exercise doesn't significantly contribute to weight loss as
a result. Calorie restriction is another unsustainable approach because it
requires so much willpower. 97% of people who follow a diet tend to regain all
the weight they lost, but that number is conservative.

So go keto methodically.

Down regulate sugar burning
Up regulate energy from fat and ketones

Turn the dial up or down on daily fat intake.

- 21 day reset challenge
- 6 week keto


### Anti aging

Ketones are a high octane fuel. Less inflammation and oxidative stress when
burning keytones than glucose. Requires the use of mitochondria (the "power
plants" of the cell). Advanced Glycation Endfactor.

The longest lasting cells in the body are the most vulnerable. This is why
diabetics have vision, kidney, heart problems.

Up regulating internally manufactured anti-oxidants.

Ketones have an epigenetic signaling effect too turn on genes that regulate
inflammation. Beta hydroxy butyrate. Try taking a high dose of ketones next time
you have a headache.

### Anti Cancer

Cancer cells burn glucose at an accelerated rate. Reducing glucose intake
starves cancer cells and prevents them from reproducing. People have succeeded
in stopping advanced stage cancer and shrinking cancer down to nothing by
consuming 0 grams of carbs per day.

### Endurance

The main question in the endurance world has always been: "how can I get better
at burning fat and sparing glycogen so that I can last longer?"

The answer was usually: stuff face with high carb calories to be able to run off
the sugar.

To learn how to burn fat you have to go slower to teach your body how to burn
fat.

When you're in keto you don't need glucose to fuel. You become bonk proof.

- FASTER study by Volek and Finny
  - Fat adapted athletes were burning twice as many calories of fat per minute
    than what was thought possible

  - Before: 95% sugar 5% fat at a comfortable pace
  - After fat adapted: 75% fat 25% glucose at the same pace

  - Time to bonk: 5 hours to 86 hours Sami Inken after 5 weeks of fat adapted
    eating. 200w of cycling output. To prove their benefits they rowed for 45
    days from SF to Hawaii consuming 80% fat stored onboard.

Opens up a new paradigm for fueling. And you're burning a cleaner fuel source
instead of generating a high amount of reactive oxygen species and causing
systemic inflammation throughout the body.

## Strength Power

- Activates genes at the epigenetic level that are protein sparing
- Prevents lean muscle breakdown for gluconeogenis to fuel the brain during rest
- Enhances oxygen delivery and neutransmitters in the brain
  - Recruit more motor neurons to fire when you're strength training
- Central governor theory
  - Your muscles aren't actually completely fatigued
  - When you're brain burns cleaner you get improved central governor control
    which increases strength
  - Workouts will seem easier
- Benefits from dropping excess body fat and improved strength to weight ratio
