Idea: Development process as a continual reconciliation loop.

Often when working on our codebases we see room for improvement but shrug it off
(for many reasons: maybe it's too complex, maybe you're on tight deadlines,
maybe your team doesn't care about excellence, maybe it's a "throwaway
prototype"), or add a `TODO` where we see the improvement.

Over time your codebase might be littered with TODOs, or your backlog is bloated
with tons of seemingly inconsequential tasks that don't indicate much
improvement when evaluated in isolation.

All these somewhat disparate issues represent the diff between a project is and
where you want it to be. If that diff can be accurately represented, then the
dev process simply becomes a reconciliation loop to continually shrink the diff.

This lets you determine:

- current state
- desired state
- diff between current and desired

Excellence is often made up of "nice to haves" or a collection of many
seemingly-inconsequential things that get overlooked. Being explicit about what
excellence means gives your team a chance to actually achieve it.
