Requirements of intelligent debate

- high level of empathy
- no ego
- has a purpose
- a genuine concern for truth and logic
- permissivness to be wrong, silly even

Litmus test: Could you say in your group of peers something utterly false and
ridiculous under the pretence of being serious without fear of looking like a
complete idiot?

It's very useful to say something silly just to take the temperature and figure
out specifically what aspect people will push back against first. It might not
be the most obvious thing to you.
