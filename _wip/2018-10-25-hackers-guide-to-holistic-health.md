This post is written more as a guide for my future self than anything, and
forced me to go deep and formalize my knowledge on all the ares of health and
fitness that I've slowly accumulated over the last year. It will probably be
updated with new content as I continue to learn and progress through my
personal health journey. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or medical practitioner
of any kind. This isn't advice, it's my personal journey and perspective on
health.

## Change

Make small, manageable changes. Don't attempt to implement all suggestions at
the same time. For one thing it's super hard and you'll probably burn yourself
out. For another it'll be hard to observe the affects of changes if you're
making them all at once.

The general road map is:

- Start living primally
- Self quantify (cheat sheet, blood chemistry calculator, wellness FX, MAF testing)
- Add supplements
- Dial in an exercise program
- Incorporate more advanced biohacking


## Find your motivation

Changing lifestyle and habits is hard. Without a really good reason to do so,
most of us won't actually make lasting change. For this reason it's important to
understand your own motivation for improving your health. There needs to be some
level of desperation. For many who have embraced alternative holistic ancestral
health there was a major health issue that drove them to discover, learn and
embark on the long journey. For others it's a strong desire to operate at the
highest level. My personal motivation was a combination of sports performance
and cognitive benefits. I started to get more serious about mountain biking,
racing, and rock climbing, and wanted a more methodical, systematic way of
training and measuring performance over time. At the same time in work I noticed
I didn't have quite the mental edge or motivation and inspiration levels I had
in past years. These two factors were very strong motivators for me to learn and
change, and have sustained me through the journey. Because of it, it never
really feels like work. It feels more like progress.

Group changes into levels of importance. First eat move and sleep primally.
