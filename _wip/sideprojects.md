How to avoid burnout: work more!

Link-baity title aside, I'm serious. I want to convince you that writing more
code, learning more things, spending more time at your computer can help you
avoid burning out on your normal work.

This is something I've observed over years of working full time, and
intermittently working on various side projects throughout.

It *especially* applies when working on hard projects. I've worked on complex
projects where I felt like I barely accomplished anything as weeks went by;
where I was unable to get a good grasp of how the pieces fit together for long
periods of time. This type of work can burn you out so quickly if you don't have
something else to succeed on. Coding is a drug. It's known[citation] that
there's a chemical reaction in your brain every time you solve a problem or
create something. Complex projects reduce how often you get the high we crave,
so burn out makes sense: if we aren't solving problems and creating things, why
else would be sitting at our keyboards typing in the most tedious syntaxes and
working with cosmically broken tools? We do it for the high. The feeling of
creating something out of nothing. The elegance and beauty in the cooperation of
many parts that add up to something meaningful. And the power of course.
Programmers love power, the narcissists.

So what should your side project be? It could be anything that interests you,
but here are some that have worked for me:

- Learning RubyMotion, Swift and the iOS UI Framework while building a simple app
- Prototyping startup ideas
- Learning Clojure and using it to build an epic open source chat bot
- Learning ClojureScript and Om / Reagent
- Hacking on an automated homebrew system with Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- [Learning Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

None of these side projects are particularly hard. What they are is interesting,
somewhat challenging, but the key for me is that I was able to make steady
progress almost all the time. This contrasts with work projects, which can be
quite hard, and can progress very slowly. This slow pace or feeling of being
stuck is what has driven me to despair the most.

Pick something you're interested and work on it. Share it with others. Discuss
it on freenode and with your coworkers. Blog about it. A sideproject might be
exactly what you need to sustain your sanity through the toughest times at work.
