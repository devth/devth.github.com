If you are writing code that will someday be read or used by someone else (99%
of code), you should be writing it for them. That "someone else" could also be
you in 18 months.

But it's not just the code. It's also everything around the code:

- How are tests run? Are they run automatically?
- How is documentation generated?
- How is it deployed? Does the project capture its own infrastructure
  requirements? Are they captured in docs or something more formal, like a
  Dockerfile? Can it be deployed in a continuous fashion?

It's easy to build that first 80%. But stick with it, and add the remaining
polish so that your code is a joy to work with instead of a burden.
