# TLS Koans

TLS is supposed to be scary, right?

It's actually ultra-simple; just somewhat arcane. Let's practice the most common
tasks to remove the fear from you.

## SANs

## Steps involved in issuing a cert

## BYOCA

Oh crap, CA is hard. Why is it hard? The hardest part is just building the right
ssl config.

## Private key

The simplest possible thing. Gen a key, never print it, and go store it in your
password manager.

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | pbcopy
```
