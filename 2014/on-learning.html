        <p>It wasn’t until I was well into my twenties that I learned how to really learn.
And it was only by learning many hard concepts related to programming on my own
that I observed and proved what worked. It unlocked a sort of power. Realizing
how to learn nearly any hard topic is an incredibly useful skill. I found that
efficient learning techniques had nothing to do with typical class structures
found in high school or university settings, which had previously drained my
desire to learn. In that regard, the subject of learning, or learning how to
learn is something I find very interesting and think about a fair amount, so
when I found the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/learning-002">Learning How to
Learn</a> class on Coursera by Dr. Barbara
Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski I immediately signed up. Here are my notes and
observations gained from the class.</p>

<h2 id="modes">Modes</h2>

<p>There are two primary modes of thought:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focused</strong>: this mode is engaged when you’re doing something you already
know how to do, quickly accessing the learned connections in your brain. The
connections are very tightly spaced in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Diffuse</strong>: this mode is for open minded thought that allows you to make new
connections in your brain. You can think of this mode as exercising your
brain muscle and letting your mind wonder. Edison and Dalí are famous
examples of thinkers who practiced the diffuse mode: they would hold
something in their hands while day-dreaming until dozing off to sleep at
which point they’d drop the object and wake themselves back up in order to
take what they learned and apply it in a focused mode. Diffuse mode relies on
loosely spaced connections, and is engaged by drifting off to sleep and
excercise.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="brain-facts">Brain facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The brain is the most complex device in the known universe</li>
  <li>Acquiring skills takes years and years of practice (e.g. math, chess)</li>
  <li>We are not consciously aware of how our brains work</li>
  <li>There are 10<sup>15</sup> (a million billion) synapses in the brain</li>
  <li>Brain connectivity is dynamic even after it matures</li>
  <li>Our brains develop new synapses while we sleep</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: set a 25 minute timer to focus on a specific task or goal and reward
yourself when you’re done (e.g. read the Internet, get a coffee). Use this to
build the neural patterns you need to learn new concepts. It helps to actually
write your goal down. There are a few terminal and OS X apps that can help.
Writing down the goal helps combat initial skatterbrain tendencies, which
sometimes require continual re-focusing at first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Translation and rewriting</strong>: when I read academic papers, I rarely
understand the cryptic math syntax. A good way to break through is to
translate the syntax to something you do understand. For me, this means
Haskell. Then rewrite the plain text sections in your own words (tip: try
writing a blog post that sumarizes the paper). You can’t help but internalize
the concepts when you do this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handwritten notes</strong>: when learning a library of any complexity, simply reading
the source doesn’t always help. You need to run it and observe the values in
context and the execution path. A debugger can help here. While you’re doing
this, take handwriten notes on important functions and variable values. Sketch
out an execution tree. You may never refer to these notes again, but the mere
act of physically writing them makes abstract concepts more concrete.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="abstract-concepts">Abstract Concepts</h2>

<p>Abstract concepts in particular require much more practice to create concrete
neural thought patterns. The initial neural pattern is there but it is very
weak. When you solve a problem again you strengthen that pattern. When you’ve
done it so many times you have it down, the thought pattern is very strong.</p>

<p>Study and focus intently, then take a break to allow the brain’s diffuse mode
to help you out with your conceptual understanding. “Neural mortar has a chance
to dry”.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p><strong>Long term</strong> memory vs <strong>working memory</strong>.</p>

<p>Working memory (prefrontal cortex) is what you’re currently focusing and working
on. It can hold about 4 chunks of information. We naturally group things into
chunks (e.g. phone numbers). Working memory is like a blackboard.</p>

<p>Long term memory is like a storage warehouse, spread over different areas of the
brain. To store something in long term memory you need to revisit it several
times. We can store billions of items, but they can bury each other. Spaced
repetition is one technique of storing something in long term memory: repeat
something over a number of days.</p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>Being awake causes toxic products in your brain. When you sleep your brain cells
shrink, causing an increased space between them, allowing fluid to wash the
toxins out.</p>

<p>It’s also an important part of the memory and learning process: it organizes the
things you’re learning. It rehearses neural patterns of things you’re learning,
strengthening and deepening them.</p>

<p>If you focus on what you’re learning right before you take a nap you have an
increased chance of dreaming about it, especially if you want to dream about it.
Dreaming about what you’re studying can enhance your ability to understand: it
consolidates your memories into easier-to-grasp chunks.</p>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>

<p>Physical excercise engages the diffuse mode of thinking. This is why it’s so
important to excercise. I try to make some form of excercise a part of my daily
routine as a lifestyle rather than a discipline. For example, I used to commute
by bike 5 miles each way to work when I lived in Seattle. This was an excellent
way to start the morning, and end the work day. Now that I work from home, I
mountain bike over lunch during the summer, and walk, run or go to the climbing
gym during the winter. Many times as I’ve thought about a problem while in the
zen state of singletrack mountain biking, the diffuse mode of thinking has
brought a very different perspective and creativity to problem solving.</p>

<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>

<p>It’s important to work in a space that inspires you to create. If you work from
home, carve out a dedicated space to work, and spend time desigining or
remodeling if necessary to make it suit your needs. For me, this means a modern
space with interesting art and a mix of home made physical computing hackery.</p>

<p>It also helps if you’re working near other people are creating and hacking. If
you work from home, try to make time to work from coffee shops, find a coworking
space to occassionally work from, or even meet up with a friend who freelances
to work together.</p>

<h2 id="chunking">Chunking</h2>

<p>A chunk is a network of neurons working together, built from practice and
repetition. New concepts often don’t make sense in relation to other concepts as
part of the bigger picture. It’s important to connect new material to existing
knowledge. Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together. One of
the first steps to learning is creating chunks which are connected to knowledge
through meaning. Once you chunk an idea you don’t need to remember all the
underlying details.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-form-a-chunk">How to form a chunk</h3>

<p>Consider learning a new song on the guitar. The entire song could be considered
one large chunk, but can also be broken down into mini-chunks that are easier to
learn through repetition. You can then join the mini-chunks together into larger
chunks. The joining process can be continually repeated to build up larger and
larger chunks. The point of joining small chunks into a larger one is so that
you don’t even need to consciously think about connecting the individual neural
networks.</p>

<p>Learning a language is another example. At first you learn pronounciation and
how to string together words to form simple sentences. As you progress, you can
more creatively string together complex phrases to communicate subtleties.</p>

<p>When learning a mental concept, form a chunk by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Focus your undivided attention on the subject</li>
  <li>Understand the basic idea you’re trying to chunk: let focus and diffuse mode
alternate in order to synthesize the gist. There are two approaches that work
together. The bottom up approach involves chunking and repetition while top
down involves understanding the big picture. Both perspectives are vital and
meet at the context level, which helps you learn how and when a chunk applies
to the big picture.</li>
  <li>Practice and repetition</li>
</ol>

<p>It helps to learn major concepts first, then go back in and fill in the details.</p>
