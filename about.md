Software engineer with nearly two decades experience crafting high quality web
and mobile applications. Very interested in making your life easier. I care
deeply about wielding technology to build great products and experiences. I've
worked on doing just that at every layer of the stack:

- extensive experience iterating on meticulously-detailed frontends for client
  sites, interactive experiences, and web applications
- at the API level efficiently piping and transforming data between backend and
  frontend with considerations around concurrency and authentication
- at the very backend working on a Scala-based in-memory distributed columnar
  data store for eBay which powered real-time analytics for seller tools
- as a Site Reliability Engineer creating automation, standards, and
  modern container-based infrastructure in public and private clouds

Strong proponent of using automation to make processes more efficient and
repeatable. I build an open source chat bot called
[Yetibot](https://github.com/devth/yetibot) for this purpose and for fun.

Obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I abhor unsoundness, boilerplate, repetitive code and senseless
abstraction. This has led me down a path of ongoing language discovery, from:

- my early dark ages in Perl, JavaScript, Lingo and VB
- middle ages in C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby and Python, Java
- up to modern day using Scala with Scalaz (investigating Cats), Clojure and
  ClojureScript, Datalog (via Datomic), some Swift
- and playing with Haskell, Eta, Elm and any other mind-bending languages that
  come to my attention

The past several years I've been on a quest to bring more rigor to my
understanding and use of programming, and have become a bit of a Functional
Programming zealot in the process, though my understanding of Category Theory is
a work in progress.

Most of my post topics are areas I wanted to better understand, and writing
about them was a way to achieve that. I don't claim to be an expert in
everything I write about. Please give me feedback, good or bad! If you'd like to
chat, I usually hang out on freenode.net as `devth`, or you can Tweet
[@devth](https://twitter.com/devth).

I currently work remotely on a globally-distributed team for a seed-stage
startup based in San Francisco and live in Montana with my wife and three kids.
I'm an aspiring electronics tinkerer, musician, climber, [mountain biker and
cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/devth), learner, avid [listener of
music](https://www.last.fm/user/trevorhartman), and maker of things.
