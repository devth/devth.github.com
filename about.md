I'm what some people call a full stack developer, but really I just like to make
stuff, and view the abundance of technology as a tool instead of a barrier or
specialization.

I'm obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I can't handle boilerplate or repetitive code. This has lead me down a
path of ongoing language discovery, from my early dark ages in Perl and VB, to
C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby, Scala, Clojure and core.logic, Haskell and Elm, and
a tiny bit of Idris. The past few years I've been on a quest to bring more rigor
to my understanding and use of programming, and have become a bit of a
Functional Programming zealot in the process. I'm an idealist in the continuous
process of making ideals a reality.

I currently work remotely for eBay's Seattle office and live in Montana with my
wife and two kids. I have a notebook full of ideas not yet started longer than
I'd care to admit.
