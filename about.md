Senior software engineer with over 15 years experience crafting high quality web
and mobile applications. Very interested in making your life easier, and mine
too! I care deeply about product and UX and using technology to build great
things. I've worked on doing just that at every layer of the stack:

- extensive experience iterating on meticulously-detailed frontends for client
  sites, interactive experiences, and web applications
- at the API level efficiently piping and transforming data between backend and
  frontend with considerations around concurrency and authentication
- at the very backend working on a Scala-based in-memory distributed columnar
  data store for eBay which powered real-time analytics for seller tools
- as a Site Reliability Engineer creating automation, standards, and
  modern container-based infrastructure in public and private clouds

I'm a huge proponent of using automation to make processes more efficient and
repeatable. I build an open source chat bot called
[Yetibot](https://github.com/devth/yetibot) which we increasingly use for
[ChatOps](http://devops.com/2014/07/16/chatops-communicating-speed-devops/) to
run internal automation.

I'm obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I abhor boilerplate, repetitive code or senseless abstraction.  This
has led me down a path of ongoing language discovery, from my early dark ages in
Perl, JavaScript, Lingo and VB, middle ages in C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby and
Python, Java up to modern day using Scala with Scalaz, Clojure and
ClojureScript, some Datalog, some Swift, some Haskell, and a tiny bit of Elm.

The past several years I've been on a quest to bring more rigor to my
understanding and use of programming, and have become a bit of a Functional
Programming zealot in the process.

Most of my post topics are areas I wanted to better understand, and writing
about them was a way to achieve that. I don't claim to be an expert in
everything I write about. If you have any type of feedback, good or bad, please
leave it in the comments. If you'd like to chat, I usually hang out on
freenode.net as `devth`, or you can Tweet [@devth](https://twitter.com/devth).

I currently work remotely on a globally-distributed team for a seed-stage
startup based in San Francisco and live in Montana with my wife and three kids.
I'm an aspiring electronics tinkerer, musician, climber, mountain biker,
learner, avid [listener of music](https://www.last.fm/user/trevorhartman), and
maker of things.
