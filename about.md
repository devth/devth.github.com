I like to make stuff.

I'm obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I can't handle boilerplate, repetitive code or senseless abstraction.
This has lead me down a path of ongoing language discovery, from my early dark
ages in Perl, JavaScript, Lingo and VB, to C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby, Java,
Scala, Clojure and ClojureScript, some Datalog, some Swift, some Haskell, and a
tiny bit of Elm.

The past few years I've been on a quest to bring more rigor to my understanding
and use of programming, and have become a bit of a Functional Programming zealot
in the process.

I currently work remotely for eBay's Seattle office and live in Montana with my
wife and two kids. I have a notebook full of ideas not yet started longer than
I'd care to admit.
