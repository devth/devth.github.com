title: About
---

I'm what some people call a full stack developer, but really I just like to make
stuff, and view the abundance of technology as a tool instead of a barrier or
specialization.

I'm obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I can't handle boilerplate or repetitive code. This obsession has lead
me down a path of language discovery, from my early dark ages in Perl and VB, to
C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby, Scala, Clojure and core.logic, Haskell and Elm, and
a tiny bit of Idris.

I use tech to do things like:

- build elegant, usable frontends
- efficiently pipe data from disparate services to a unified API endpoint
- write iPhone apps
- design distributed coordination algorithms to evenly assign partitions across
  any given number of instances
- create interactive data visualizations
- hack physical computing projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi hardware
  (current project: automated brewing system)
- produce generative music

I currently work remotely for eBay's Seattle office and live in Montana with my
wife and two kids. I have a notebook full of ideas not yet started longer than
I'd care to admit.
