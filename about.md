I like to make stuff.

I'm obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I can't handle boilerplate, repetitive code or senseless abstraction.
This has lead me down a path of ongoing language discovery, from my early dark
ages in Perl, JavaScript, Lingo and VB, to C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby and
Python, Java, Scala, Clojure and ClojureScript, some Datalog, some Swift, some
Haskell, and a tiny bit of Elm.

The past few years I've been on a quest to bring more rigor to my understanding
and use of programming, and have become a bit of a Functional Programming zealot
in the process.

Most of my post topics are areas I wanted to better understand, and writing
about them was a way to achieve that. I don't claim to be an expert in
everything I write about. If you have any type of feedback, good or bad, please
leave it in the comments! If you'd like to chat, I usually hang out on
freenode.net as `devth`, or you can Tweet [@devth](https://twitter.com/devth).

I currently work remotely for eBay's Seattle office and live in Montana with my
wife and three kids. I have a notebook full of ideas not yet started longer than
I'd care to admit.
