Yetibot is now [on Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/devth/yetibot/tags/)! This
is the fastest way to get up and running. To demonstrate, let's run it with
Docker using the most minimal configuration possible using an in-memory
(non-durable) Datomic configuration and a single IRC adapter config. I'm
assuming your local Docker is all [setup and
configured](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/tmp/config

$ cat << EOF > ~/tmp/config/config.edn
{:yetibot
 {:db {:datomic-url "datomic:mem://yetibot"}
  :adapters
  [{:name "freenode-irc",
    :type :irc,
    :host "chat.freenode.net",
    :port "6665",
    :username "yetibot-docker"}]}}
EOF

$ docker run --name yetibot \
  -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/tmp/config:/usr/src/app/config \
  devth/yetibot

$ docker logs -f yetibot
```

**N.B.** I chose `~/tmp/config` because:

> If you are using Docker Machine on Mac or Windows, your Docker daemon has only
> limited access to your OS X or Windows filesystem. Docker Machine tries to
> auto-share your /Users (OS X) or C:\Users (Windows) directory. So, you can
> mount files or directories on OS X using. ‚Äî [Mount a host directory as a data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume)

If you're not using Docker Machine feel free to put it wherever you like.

Once it starts up (you'll see some logs containing freenode.net) run
`/invite yetibot-docker` to some IRC channel on Freenode (you must be an op to
invite, which you can get by creating your own channel) and try it out!


```
!list yetibot on docker | xargs echo ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è %s ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
```

When you're done, clean up with:

```
docker rm -f yetibot
```
