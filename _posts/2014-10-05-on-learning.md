It wasn't until I was well into my twenties that I learned how to really learn.
And it was only by learning many hard concepts related to programming on my own
that I observed what worked. It unlocked a sort of power. Realizing how to learn
nearly any hard topic is an incredibly useful skill. I found that efficient
learning techniques had nothing to do with typical class structures found in
high school or university settings. In that regard, the subject of learning, or
learning how to learn is something I find very interesting and think about a
fair amount, so when I found the [Learning How to
Learn](https://class.coursera.org/learning-002) class on Coursera by Dr. Barbara
Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski I immediately signed up. Here are my notes and
observations gained from the class.


## Learning modes

0. Focused: doing something you already know how to do, quickly accessing the
   learned connections in your brain
0. Diffuse: open minded thought that allows you to make new connections in your
   brain. Can be thought of as exercising your brain muscle, letting your mind
   wonder. Edison and Dal√≠ are famous examples of thinkers who practiced the
   diffuse mode, holding something in their hands while day-dreaming until they
   would fall asleep, drop the object and wake themselves back up in order to
   take what they learned and apply it in a focused mode.

## Notes

- The brain is the most complex device in the known universe.
- Acquiring skills takes years and years of practice: math, chess.
- We are not consciously aware of how our brains work.
- There are a million billion synapses in the brain.
- Brain connectivity is dynamic even after it matures.
- Our brains develop new synapses while we sleep.

## Learning Techniques

- Pomodoro: 25 minute timer to focus and reward yourself when you're done (e.g. read
  the Internet, get a coffee). Use this to build the neural patterns you need to
  learn new concepts.

## Learning Abstract Concepts

- Requires much more practice to create concrete neural thought patterns. The
  initial neural pattern is there but it is very weak. When you solve the
  problem again you strengthen that pattern. When you've done it so many times
  you have it down, the thought pattern is very strong.

- Study and focus intently, then take a break to allow the brain's diffuse mode
  to help you out with your conceptual understanding. "Neural mortar has a
  change to dry".


## Memory

Long term memory vs Working memory.

Working memory (prefrontal cortex): what you're currently focusing and working
on. Can hold about 4 chunks of information. We group things into chunks. It's
like a blackboard (e.g. phone number).

Long term is like a storage warehouse, spread over different areas of the brain.
To store something in long term memory you need to revisit it several times. Can
store billions of items, but they can bury each other. Spaced repetition is one
technique: repeat something over a number of days.

## Sleeping

Being awake causes toxic products in your brain. When you sleep your brain cells
shrink, causing an increased space between them, allowing fluid to wash the
toxins out.

It's also an important part of the memory and learning process: it organizes the
things you're learning. It rehearses neural patterns of things you're learning,
strengthening and deepening them.

If you focus on what you're learning right before you take a nap you have an
increased chance of dreaming about it, especially if you want to dream about it.
Dreaming about what you're studying can enhance your ability to understand: it
consolidates your memories into easier to grasp chunks.

## Interview

Learn more easily: get into the thick of it. Don't read a lot of books (just).
Get involved in labs. Learn by doing.

How to pay attention to a boring lecture? Ask a question. Interruption might
bring more interesting: active engagement instead of passive.

Diffuse mode: how to engage? Jogging, walking, excercising.

Multitask or not? You need to be able to juggle to get through the day. However,
the evenings are good time to get your best work done.

Two things at the same time? Not possible, consciously, but you can with a lot
of training. Multitasking is really context switching very quickly.

Apply knowledge of neuralscience to your own learning? In the lab: neurons you
have at birth. After birth wiring takes place but they're the same neurons. Some
die and shrink. Hippocampus: new neurons are being born. If you put a rat in an
enriched environemtn where it can interact, the connections in the nuerons in
the hippocampus are much stronger. In the absence of a rich environment:
excercise can also. A pitty in our schools: they cut out recess when students
need to take tests.

Special techinques to learn or focus? Being in a creative environment where
other people are creative enhances your own creativity. 

Test taking: you can learn to be a better test taker. Things to avoid: don't get
hung up, go on to the next. The answer may pop into your brain later in the
test.

How Approach creative work and science? Students and colleges keep you young.

Advice for college /high school student? Success does not come just from being
smart. It has more to do with passion and persistence.

Look at things from a new perspective.


## Conclusion Week 1

Two modes of thinking.

- Focus: tight spacing between connections. prefrontal cortex. Thinking about
things you're already familiar with
- Diffuse: loose spacing between connections. Brain's resting states. Excercise or
drifting off to sleep activates this part of the brain.

Easiest way to tackle procrastination is pomodoro.

Practice and repetition is very important for abstract concepts.
